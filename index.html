            Kumar Sangakkara, an elegant stroke player, a reliable keeper, an astute thinker, was the cornerstone of Sri Lankan cricket 
for close to 15 years. After playing close to 500 international games for his country, the all-time great cricketer played 
his final game in a Test against India at Colombo (PSS) in 2015.Sangakkara's arrival on the cricket scene was sensational. 
A blistering 156 against Zimbabwe A in 2000 was enough to convince the selectors of his ability. Rewarded with a place in the 
one-day squad at the age of only 22, he won his first Man of the Match award in his second game. He scored his maiden Test 
century in his tenth Test after missing out twice before by getting out in the 90s. His batting was bordered by a temperament 
beyond his age.
